Polynomial Curve Fitting in MATLAB

This project implements polynomial curve fitting for a set of data points using MATLAB. It fits linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomials to the data by solving the normal equations derived from the least squares method. The script visualizes the original data alongside the fitted curves, providing insight into how polynomial degree affects fit quality.

Key features include:

Manual computation of polynomial coefficients using matrix algebra.

Comparison of fits of different polynomial degrees.

Clear graphical visualization with scatter plots and fitted curves.

Output of polynomial coefficients for further analysis.

This project demonstrates fundamental skills in numerical methods, data modeling, and MATLAB programming, useful for signal processing, scientific data analysis, and engineering applications.
